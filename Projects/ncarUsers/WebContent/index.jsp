                This sample application illustrates how to build RESTful web services and dynamic web applications with the multi-tier 
                architecture discussed in the  article (http://article), and how RESTful web services, Ajax and Spring Web Flow work 
                together to produce a desktop-like rich web interface. The application tier is built using Java. The tutorial 
                uses Jersey, Spring and MySQL, and uses Eclipse as an IDE.
